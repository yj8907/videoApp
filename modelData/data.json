So that you have all of the facts, and for others who will read this review, we offer this\u2026 For more than 50 years, the Exploratorium has offered a place for the curious to learn more about the world around them. We encourage visitors of all ages and staff to ask questions and question answers\u2014and millions of people from around the world have done so. We have inspired countless students, scientists, doctors, artists, makers, innovators, and educators with our work. While the Palace of Fine Arts (PFA) will always be a part of who we are as an iconic SF organization, the space was also much smaller and did not give the museum ample room to grow both our reach and experience. Nearly all of the popular experiences and exhibits from the PFA were moved to the new location at Pier 15, and hundreds more exhibits were also added in a much brighter, more open modern space.

We arrived on the\nRead more\nDate of experience: May 2019\n1 Helpful vote\nHelpful\nShare\nResponse from Mike S, Owner at Barebottle Brewing Company\nResponded May 13, 2019\nHi Heidi, I read your review here, and also the 1-star review you left for us on Yelp, and also the verbatim email you sent (your message was received loud and clear). I am sorry that you had a negative experience at Barebottle. Parsing your review, it seems like there were three main areas of negative feedback: 1) Lack of beer variety, particularly stouts and porters, especially during beer week. 2) Lack of seating due to pre-reserved tables 3) Requiring your ID in order to be served beer. Regarding #1 - I have to humbly disagree. During beer week, we debuted not one, but two! pretty incredible stouts. First, we worked with the fine folks at Humphrey Slocombe Ice Cream to develop a liquid version of their insanely delicious Secret Breakfast ice cream. The result was a white nitro stout, using vanilla, a touch of coffee, corn flakes, and a hint of bourbon. I just tasted this beer again last weekend, and remarkably it was just as delicious as it was when we released in February. Second, we had the good pleasure to work with Socola Chocolatiers, based in SoMA. If you haven't checked them out, I would highly highly recommend you do so. They make a famous Vietnamese chocolate truffle, which we again, turned into a liquid libation we called \"Socola Imperial Vietnamese Pastry Stout.\" You may have seen this in Whole Foods as it was also available on shelves there for a limited time. But in any event, your comment about beer variety is a fair one, and we will endeavor to have more stouts/porters, and more styles in general, available in our taproom. Thank you for that feedback. Regarding #2 - you are absolutely correct that some tables are reserved, especially for events like Mother's Day. We strive to reserve no more than 50% of the tables on any given day. There are many places that do not allow reservations of any kind, and we've chosen to do about half. The reason is pretty simple: we are lucky enough to have a space that lends itself well to small groups, and there are precious few places in San Francisco where you can reliably get a space for a group and not get charged outrageous prices for doing so. But I hear you that it is frustrating to go to a place and see all the tables reserved. We will continue to figure out ways to balance that equation more equitably. In the meantime, I would humbly offer this suggestion: getting a table is usually only a problem between the hours of 2PM-6PM on Saturdays. Those are the busiest hours at the brewery, and it is difficult for us to control when people choose to visit us. If you would like to be guaranteed a table, please visit us literally any other day of the week, or on Saturdays before 2PM or after 6PM. It takes a bit of planning, but it might make for a more enjoyable experience all around. Regarding #3 - as someone with graying hair myself, I know this is frustrating to be asked to present ID. I was at my 20 year high school graduation party at a venue in Seattle and couldn't go in because I had forgotten my ID, and I missed the chance to reconnect with many of my old friends. I was extremely disappointed, but I understood that, especially with large venues, the owners and managers of the company sometimes have to set policies and procedures that may upset people, but overall help to ensure everyone is safe. For example, you noted in your review there are a few areas in the brewery which are adjacent to the main taproom. Our staff regularly monitors these areas, but as a way not to disturb guests, we look for a stamp on people's hands so that we know that everyone who is drinking is above the legal age. It is also a communication tool to those who might attempt to break these rules (as people are inclined to do) that even if they do get their hands on a glass, it won't last for long. It isn't personal, it is a blanket policy we set to help avoid problems. Lastly, we check the ID of every guest who comes through our door to ensure that if an Alcohol Beverage Control Officer does visit us, we stay on the right side of the law. We employ more than 30 people at Barebottle, most of whom live in the city, and do not work in tech. These people are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and friends. They work hard, and they earn a living wage. To put at risk our license, and thereby the jobs, and livelihood of our valued employees is not something we are comfortable with. So, it may seem draconian to ask for your ID, but it is a small act of cooperation we humbly ask to keep things moving along. Heidi, I do appreciate your feedback, and I thank you for visiting us from the beginning. I do hope that you give us another try, and we will endeavor to make your experience better the next time. Yours humbly, - Mike\nRead more", "My son and daughter in-law celebrated their marriage with a reception for friends and family at Barebottle Brewing Company.

We did, however offer you a FREE SUV upgrade ($160 value) from your sedan car choice you had selected which would have arrived only an hour and 15 minutes later. This would have included a 7 passenger leather interior XL vehicle for your small group instead of a 4 seat sedan, as well as more complimentary wine. This offer was immediately rejected, as you had a strict Napa reservation tasting at 10am from a very small winery that has zero flexibility to accommodate schedule changing on a slow day like Monday. Subsequent to the rejection of free upgrade, our office had to call in for a full refund to Viator. We ALWAYS encourage customers who are getting picked up in San Francisco to allow our concierge to help plan the day in tasting scheduling, so that an unforeseeable emergency delays or severe traffic adding up to 45 minute to an hour, will be an easily solvable issue doesn't ruin the whole day. We do a phenomenal job organizing wineries and appointment times into schedule not only by order of geographic convenience but also by the winery's general flexibility in tasting availability and by adequate and professional staffing per winery.

Most travelers to Bhutan spend an average of 8 nights in Bhutan, visiting just western Bhutan. I was truly impressed that you and your wife wanted to visit the entire country and arranged your busy schedules to accommodate a personal journey to Eastern Bhutan with Karchung, our field manager, and then return to Paro to begin a twelve night cultural trip from Paro to the Tang Valley with the rest of your family. What an epic trip! Because of your keen interest to meet and engage with locals, scholars, artisans, and professionals in the field of health and government, we were able to arrange personal visits to expand your understanding of Bhutan. I've known Karchung for more than twenty years, and there is no doubt that he is an 'ambassador' for his country. His wide range of knowledge, engaging and caring personality are just a few reasons our travelers love to travel with him. Thank you for requesting Karchung lead your family trip - he thoroughly enjoyed every minute and was delighted to show you his new home in Paro, also. On behalf of myself and Karchung, we thank you for your high endorsement of our services. Tashi Delek!

I don't think any of us could forget the warm welcomes on the many islands we visited - few villages had ever seen foreigners, but they asked us into their homes, invited us to tea, and even asked us to hold their babies in our arms. I was especially impressed with the mixed Christian and Muslim villages that were co-existing harmoniously. The islands are a haven for brilliant marine life, and judging from your compelling underwater photos, we knew this to be true. But, as we learned from a renowned marine biologist in Banda, local people, cultural tourists, and diving boats need to be educated in marine conservation to keep the waters clean so that the islands will continue to be unforgettable experiences. Thank you for your wonderful review of our exploratory cruise to the Spice Islands. KZ Fung\nRead more", "Our first trip to Africa and my husband and I were well taken care of by Kathleen Fung.

We will always appreciate any feed back to improve our service. We do not want to give excuse for the things that you did not like with our service but we hope by explaining little bit more, that you would consider using our services again. Yes, the reservation was made on short notice after we answered your quote request that was submitted online. The online quote request, requested and asked for a Sedan quote rather than the SUV. There could have been a misunderstanding regarding the car, because when you asked us what type of car, we will be sending you, we informed at the 10:30pm slot schedule, the car we will be assigning was a Cadillac. But as you have said, we sent a sedan since your flight arrived 40 minutes earlier than scheduled time. We did track the flight and a Lincoln sedan was sent because Cadillac was only available after 10:30pm. The pick up was an a curb side pick up, and in our terms and conditions it does inform the curb side pick up takes 5-7 minutes. The reason it takes 5-7 minutes is based on which terminal you are coming out of. First terminal would be 5 minutes and the last terminal 7 minutes, after you have informed us that you are ready. And we definitely apologize it did take us 15 minutes to arrive at the door and you left the airport after 20 minutes by our text message records. But I hope you consider that this was right around Christmas, where the airport is most busy around the Holiday Time. Our driver tried her best to arrive at curb within 15 minutes when some drivers were taking 20-30 minutes and asking us to ask clients to go to Departures for earlier pick up. We sincerely apologize, for not clarifying if you needed a sedan or an SUV based on your luggage amount and just booked the sedan quote you requested. We should have explained everything more better and informed you that curb side pick up at airport was so busy due to traffic of Holiday and if you needed Meet and Greet service since there was so much traffic.

As negative as it may seem on the surface, I'd like to turn this into a positive as it presents me the opportunity to listen to our customers and address shortcomings. I personally value all of our customers and go the extra mile to make each rental a wonderful experience. That SF Powerboat Rentals has thus far received only positive reviews, yours being the first negative review received, is a measure of my commitment to give our customers a fun, safe, and positive experience. On the matter of our valet showing up 15 minutes late, there simply is no excuse. In this regard, I apologize for our tardiness and the inconvenience it caused you. We strive to be on time for our customers - a message I communicate very strongly to my valet team who meets up with our renters to handover the boat. I'd like to add that these guys are highly qualified powerboat operators with many years of experience. Matt, the valet who was late for you, served in the Australian Navy and has several years of experience working and operating high powered RIBS, water taxis, and cruise ships plying Sydney Harbor. He has had an outstanding on-time track record with our customers but regrettably in your case, inexcusably fell short and was late. Our being late can result from a handful of factors, from a prior renter returning the boat late, to something like what you experienced wherein circumstances were totally under our control yet we failed to make it on time. When this occurs, whatever the reason may be, we always extend the return time so that our customers have the boat for the full length of rental time they paid for. If you are pressed for time and cannot extend your schedule, we will always give you a pro-rated refund for the time you actually have the boat. While our being on time is very important to me, the matter of safety is paramount and of critical importance. Your experience and close call with a dangerous situation at Alcatraz, while alarming to me personally, is also something we can all learn from and presents a teachable moment not just for me, but more so for anyone who might be reading this. Please keep this in mind as you go through my response. Safety IS and MUST always be the prime concern when renting our boats. On the bay, the renter is responsible not only for himself and his passengers on the boat, but also for other vessels on the water and his surroundings. My valet team is instructed to familiarize our customers with the boat (including pointing out life vests and other US Coast Guard-mandated safety equipment) prior to their leaving the slip and to NOT PROCEED with letting renters have the boat IF it is discovered you have no prior boating experience. As a business, we DO NOT and WILL NOT allow anyone without boating experience to take out our boats. Having boating experience and knowing how to safely operate a powerboat has always been a precondition for anyone to take out a boat. This is borne by the fact that when signing the rental agreement and liability waiver required to rent a boat, all renters, including yourself, must first attest and stipulate to the following: 1. That you are an EXPERIENCED BOATER, familiar with operating a powerboat and with knowledge of navigation rules. 2. That you assume all risks and liabilities for any loss, damages, or injury resulting from an accident due to your fault or negligence. 3. That you are familiar with and assume ALL RISKS associated with renting a powerboat. That you say Matt, our boat valet, let you have the boat even after telling him you had no prior boating experience is of concern to me as a failure on our part that must not happen again. At the same time, I must assess our own booking process and also point out that prior to picking up the boat, you signed the rental agreement and liability waiver online, clearly stipulating that you had prior boating experience, knew how to safely operate a powerboat, and had knowledge of navigation rules. It is incumbent on our customers to read what they are signing and agreeing to as well as to be transparent and forthcoming with us on their boating experience. As California does not require a boating license to drive a boat, we screen and qualify renters based mainly on the information we are provided. Aside from the requirement of presenting a valid driving license, renting a boat is similar to renting a car in the sense that the car rental company assumes that the renter knows how to drive a car and is familiar with the the rules of the road. If a driver goes down a one-way street the wrong way and hits another car, that person cannot assign blame or responsibility on the car rental company for not instructing him on rules of the road or what a One-way Sign or Do Not Enter Sign means. In your case, those BUOYS around Alcatraz are the equivalent of that One-way or Do Not Enter road sign, and as the experienced boater that you stipulated you were in the rental agreement you signed, we reasonably assumed you would know what the buoys were there for. Given your account that you had informed Matt of your lack of boating experience when he turned over the boat to you, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt that he did not fully hear, understand, or appreciate your lack of boating experience. Had he known that you would be putting yourself in danger and not know well enough to stay clear of rocky outcrops or to recognize buoys, I am certain he would not have let you gone out on your own as is our policy; at the very least, he would have given you strong instruction and guidance on the matter. As you discovered, knowing how to operate a boat is not as simple as it looks. Something as simple as leaving and returning to the dock can be very challenging. A strong incoming surge can easily push you towards a collision with another boat next to you or with the pier if you do not know how to handle the surge, a skill that comes only with experience. The bay is also a busy waterway and boaters must know navigation rules. Who has the right of way? How close can I get to a commercial ship? What do I do when on a collision course with another vessel? What are buoys and what purpose do they serve? One must know the answers to these questions before they take a boat out on the water and not just ask for a rundown on the rules before getting on the boat. In addition to navigation rules, bay conditions can also change dramatically. Knowing how to operate a boat properly, adjusting your angle, speed, engine trim and trim tabs to address wakes and choppy conditions when they arise will make your ride more safe, dry, and enjoyable. There is a long list of written as well as unwritten common sense rules and guidelines on safely operating a powerboat and navigating the bay that cannot be communicated and learned in the 5 minutes it takes to hand over the boat to our renters. To hold us responsible and expect us to be able to teach you all those things when handing over the boat is simply unrealistic. In much the same way that a car rental company does not teach you driving rules and regulations or how to read road signs when you pick up your rental car, we simply cannot teach you all the things you need to know in order to safely navigate the bay when you accept our boat. Ultimately, while we do what we can to familiarize all our customers with the operating the boat and give advise on what to look out for on the bay before they take the vessel out, the responsibility of knowing how to operate a vessel and safely navigate the bay must rest squarely with the renter. This holds even truer when the renter tells us by signing the rental agreement and liability waiver that he has prior experience safely operating a powerboat and is familiar with navigation rules. For our customers with little or no boating experience, we have powerboat instructors available to teach our renters how to operate the boat and safely navigate the bay. This option is clearly made available when a customer books a boat rental; an option you declined. By getting an instructor, renters remain at the wheel and still experience the fun and thrill of driving a boat but have guidance right beside them. It will cost an additional $30 to $50 to hire an instructor but the benefits far outweigh the potential costs in life and property should an accident occur. Your story demonstrates that hiring an instructor with your boat rental is a MUST for people with no boating experience; a lesson that would serve all readers to take note of. SF Powerboat Rentals is a small business I started about a year ago because I had guests visiting San Francisco and wanted to show them around. I thought renting a powerboat on the bay would be a fun, enjoyable, and memorable experience for all of us but I could not find a boat to rent anywhere. I thought that there must be people out there in a similar boat (pardon the pun) as I was who wanted to rent and take a powerboat out for some fun on the bay but couldn't find one, and that's how I started. My customers' experiences are very important to me. It's gratifying when they return and tell me their family and friends had a great time; and I do my best to ensure that this happens. Prior reviews received tell me that for the most part, we do a great job. Nonetheless, your review has been an eye-opener that will trigger improvements in our service and booking process. Because of your experience, we will now be reminding all future renters to stay clear of the buoy markers around Alcatraz. Our online booking process will more loudly indicate the requirement of prior boating experience and the hiring of an instructor as a requirement for renters with little or no prior boating experience. Our valets, should they discover that renters actually have little or no boating experience contrary to the rental agreement signed, are now empowered to insist that renters either hire an instructor or cancel the reservation totally. Finally, I will also re-emphasize to my team the need to be on time for our customers and work towards a 100% on-time rate. It's disappointing to me that you had a bad experience and I would like to make it right with you. If you would like to take the boat out again, contact me through the Contact Us page on my website so we can come up with something that is fair and works for both of us.

I'd like to add a few tips for readers out there. Bay conditions do change during the day, from a flat mirror-like surface to 6 ft white-capped waves. As a rule, early mornings are generally nice and i enjoy that time of day the best. Tides also ebb and flow at different times of the day during the year so its a good thing to check slack times before you book your rental. During hours that the slot between Golden gate bridge and Alcatraz are choppy, its useful to know how to operate the engine trim and trim tabs combined with adjusting your speed to give you a smoother ride. Also, in my experience, when the slot becomes choppy, just cruise in the waters south of the Bay Bridge, the area around AT&T Park and beyond. Its just a lot calmer over there.\nRead more", "I took my family to San Francisco on 2/29/16 made a reservation thru the phone with mr.

We do our best to be warm, friendly and down to earth with everyone that comes in our shop. Thanks for the heads up that this was not your experience. We hope you'll give us the opportunity to correct the mix up. If we gave you the wrong pair of gloves, it was not intentional. We always shoot for complete customer satisfaction. Please let us know where we can send the correct pair by writing to us directly. Agreed 100% on the small selection. Our speciality is commuter products with great design and is something that sets us apart from other bike shops in the area. If folks are looking for a large selection, it's not us. We do, however, hand out maps of every bike related business in the neighborhood so that we can help people find products not available through us. I'd like to invite you to write to me directly about your experience with my staff. More details will help me with coaching in the future. jefferson@missionbicycle.com Thanks for your input!
